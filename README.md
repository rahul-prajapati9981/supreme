6. ðŸ“± Responsive Design Strategy
Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g. md:, lg:, 2xl:) were used extensively to:

Stack elements vertically on mobile.

Display grid/flex columns on tablet and desktop.

Dynamically adjust spacing, padding, and typography.

7. âš¡ Performance Optimizations
Next/Image for optimized image loading.

Lazy-loaded video switcher to improve initial load.

Minimal external packages to reduce bundle size.

Tailwindâ€™s JIT mode ensures unused styles are purged.

8. â™¿ Accessibility Considerations
Semantic HTML: Used section, header, form, button, input, and textarea tags.

alt text for all images.

Sufficient color contrast and focus states.

Keyboard-friendly interactive elements.

9. ðŸ“¦ Third-party Libraries Used
Next.js â€“ React framework with SSR support.

Tailwind CSS â€“ Utility-first CSS framework.

TypeScript â€“ Static type checking.
